  "Comrade Lieutenant, our direction finders have just triangulated the location of an American V Corps radio retransmission park. Of course, we could just call in an artillery strike and destroy the entire grid, but they would just switch to an alternate node. Instead, we will send in your platoon to raid the park and capture any crypto equipment you can carry. They are a small unit and lightly defended. We will also jam their signals for about 30 minutes so they cannot call for assistance."\
  "You will be sent unobserved, into a nearby landing zone by helicopter. From there, you can hike to the objective. Jamming will commence when you are about to make contact so you can complete your mission."
